Connecting to MongoDB using Robomongo
`````````````````````````````````````
This section shows how to connect to your MongoDB server using Robomongo.
Note that MongoDB 3.2 requires you to use the latest version of Robomongo.

.. important:: If you try to connect to your MongoDB from a remote system, ensure the MongoDB configuration has either no value defined for ``bindIp`` or lists the IP address you are trying to connect to.

Make sure your MongoDB server is running and open Robomongo.
