Troubleshooting
===============

Where are the log files?
------------------------
There are multiple different log files that yield information in case of an error scenario. 
The following subsections will assist you in finding the log files for every part of the Signavio Workflow Accelerator application. 
The most important one, regarding the Workflow Accelerator system is the ``effektif.log``\ . 
It will contain any application related log entries.

Workflow Accelerator
````````````````````
The Workflow Accelerator log file effektif.log can be found in the location you configured in the logging configuration file ``$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml``\ . 
This file contains the line: ::

    <property name="LOG_DIR" value="/path/to/log"/>

The value contains the directory of the log file. Besides the ``effektif.log`` the directory contains more log files for every day of the past 30 days the server was running. 
If you are looking for any information about incidents on a specific date, open the log file with the respective timestamp.

Script Engine
`````````````
The Workflow Accelerator Script Engine log files have been configured in the configuration file ``$SCRIPT_ENGINE_HOME/configuration.onpremise.js``\ . 
The values for the entries ``log`` ``file`` and ``log`` ``errorFile`` will tell you the name and location of the log files.

Mail Relay
^^^^^^^^^^
The Workflow Accelerator Mail Relay log file ``mail.log`` has been configured in the logging configuration file ``$MAIL_RELAY_HOME/logback.xml``\ .
This file contains the line: ::

    <property name="LOG_DIR" value="/path/to/log"/>

The value contains the directory of the log file. Besides the ``mail.log`` the directory contains more log files for every day of the past 30 days the server was running. 
If you are looking for any information about incidents on a specific date, open the log file with the respective timestamp.

MongoDB 
```````
The MongoDB log file is configured by the logpath option. 
This is either defined in the MongoDB configuration file that you reference when starting MongoDB or directly as a start parameter of MongoDB. 
Anyway, the value of this parameter will tell you where to find the log file.

On Linux, one default location where the log file can be found is ``/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log``\ . 
Whereas default locations for the configuration file are ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` or ``/etc/mongod.conf``\ . 
These locations can change depending on the distribution and depend on how you have installed MongoDB.

If you are using Windows and followed the instructions in this guide to setup MongoDB, you should find the log file in your MongoDB installation directory ``$MONGO_HOME\logs``\ .

Tomcat
``````
If not configured otherwise, the log files of the Apache Tomcat application server can be found either in the installation directory of the Tomcat ``$TOMCAT_HOME\logs`` (Windows) or a common log directory e.g. ``/var/log/tomcat7`` (Linux).

Common problems
---------------
This section lists some common problems that can arise during the setup of the Workflow Accelerator system and gives instructions on how to solve them.

Problem:
    The Workflow Accelerator site shows a HTTP Status 500 error including the message ``root cause java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot find license.xml``\ . 

Solution: 
    You have not installed the Workflow Accelerator license.xml at all or placed it in the wrong directory. See :ref:`install-license` to solve the issue.

Problem:
    The Workflow Accelerator site shows a HTTP Status 500 error including the message ``com/effektif/EffektifServlet : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 (unable to load class com.effektif.EffektifServlet)``\ .

Solution:
    The Tomcat server is using the wrong Java version. Workflow Accelerator requires Java 8. Make sure you have installed the correct Java version. You can check your Java version by executing: ::

        java -version

    The :ref:`install-java` section explains how to install the correct Java version.

Problem:
    Executing a MongoDB command yields the error message ``errmsg: “unauthorized”`` or  ``errmsg: “auth fails”``\ .

Solution:
    Either the username / password combination that is used to execute the command is wrong or the respective MongoDB user lacks some required roles.

    The first issue can be checked by executing:

    Windows: ``mongo.exe admin -u signavio -p <yourSignavioUserPassword>``
    
    Debian: ``mongo admin -u signavio -p <yourSignavioUserPassword>``
    
    If this command fails with the error message ``exception: login failed`` you know that your username / password combination is wrong. Please, make sure you spelled the username and password correctly.

    In order to check the second issue, see the :ref:`add-mongodb-user` section.
    This section lists all necessary roles and explains how to verify that the Workflow Accelerator user has all the required roles.
    Especially the restore and backup commands require certain roles to work properly.

Problem:
    Workflow Accelerator does not start and the log file contains the error message ``INFO  LockingDbExecutor Database is locked by another executor. Wait...``.

Solution:
    The problem with the LockingDbExecutor arises when the application server is shut down during the initialisation (update of licenses and migration of  database) before the lock can be released again. 
    You have to manually remove the lock from the database.
    We recommend using a tool like Robomongo for this purpose.
    The :ref:`tooling-mongodb` section explains how to install Robomongo and set-up a connection to your MongoDB. 

    1. Open Robomongo.
    2. Establish a connection to MongoDB.
    3. Open the content of the Workflow Accelerator DB on the left side of the application.
    4. Under Collections you will find the table ``properties``.
    5. A double click on ``properties`` shows all entries. In case of an error you will see three entries, if everything is normal there will be only two.
    6. Out of the three entries in the list, select the one that contains the value ``schema.lock`` for the key ``k``.
    7. Use a right click to open the context menu for the respective entry and choose „Delete Document…“ to remove the entry.

    IMPORTANT: Only the entry for ``schema.lock`` must be deleted. You are advised to create a backup of the database upfront.
